## Overview
**iTavalod** is a birthday reminder app designed to help users track important dates with support for the **Jalali (Persian) calendar** alongside the Gregorian calendar. Built as my first project in **Swift** in 2016, this iOS app offers a simple and intuitive way to manage birthday reminders, catering especially to users who rely on the Jalali calendar.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete birthday reminders.
- Toggle between Jalali and Gregorian calendar formats.
- Clean and user-friendly interface.
- (Optional: Add notifications for upcoming birthdays, if implemented.)
